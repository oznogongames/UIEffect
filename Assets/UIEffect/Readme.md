## UIEffect for CapturedImage

`UIEffectCapturedImage` is unlike post effects, it only provides effects on the rendered result (= captured image) of a frame.
This effect is non-realtime, light-weight, less-camera, blit only once, but effective.

* Camera for processing effect is unnecessary.
* Process effect only once after `UIEffectCapturedImage.Capture`.
* Using reduction buffer, keep used memory size small and keep rendering load are small.
* When GameObjects with motion are on the screen, a result texture may be stirred.
* You can overlay and display like as: [Screen] | [captured image with effect] | [Dialog A] | [captured image with effect] | [Dialog B].




## Note: Unity 5.6+

In Unity 5.6+, Canvas supports **Additional Shader Channels**.  
Please enable `TexCoord1` to use UIEffect.
